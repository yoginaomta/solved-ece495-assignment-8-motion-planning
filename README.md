In this assignment, you will be developing a trajectory planner that can handle highway driving while surrounded by dynamic obstacles moving at various speeds. The planner will interface with a driving simulator to allow you to visualize the ego vehicle in motion.




<h1>Resources and Instructions</h1>




This assignment requires you to complete the following assignment:

<a href="https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Path-Planning-Project">https://github.com/udacity/CarND</a><a href="https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Path-Planning-Project">–</a><a href="https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Path-Planning-Project">Path</a><a href="https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Path-Planning-Project">–</a><a href="https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Path-Planning-Project">Planning</a><a href="https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Path-Planning-Project">–</a><a href="https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Path-Planning-Project">Project</a>




Once you’ve cloned the repo, go to “src” folder, replace “main.cpp” with the one provided on

Learn, and add “spline.h” (also on Learn) to “src” folder.  The two files are explained in this Q&amp;A video by Udacity:

Instructions for how to finish the project can be found in the README. But <strong>we have modified the grading scheme </strong>so that you make get part marks even if some criteria are not met. Please see the “Marking Scheme” section and tutorial slides for new instructions.

<h1>Deliverables</h1>




The deliverable for this project is a zipped project folder containing your developed code (i.e. whatever files you modified/created in “src”), as well as a writeup in txt or pdf format. Your submission should <strong>compile and run</strong> because we will be testing your code. Please do not include the simulator in your submission.




Please follow the naming convention for your zip file: a8_&lt;user_id&gt;.zip
